I'm Mark Hildreth, a software developer located in central Massachusetts. Aside from programming, I enjoy hiking, games (of the board, card, video and role variety), woodworking, community theater, and watching bad movies.

Also, I'm available for hire, so send me an [email](mailto:mark.k.hildreth@gmail.com): mark.k.hildreth@gmail.com
